# Logistic Regression for Landslide Occurance Prediction

## 1. Goal Difinition:
* Building a model to predict landslide occurrence.
## 2. Conceptualization
## 3. Model Type/Scale Decisions:  
* Getting data by field surveys/experiments. 
* Note that in this case the data is given and splitted into 60/20/20. 
*  x & y : coordinatest. 
* lslpts : True (landslide occured), False (no landslide). This is the variable we will try to model and
predict. 
* slope: slope angle (◦). 
* cplan: plan curvature (rad m−1) expressing the convergence or divergence of a slope and this water
flow.  
* cprof: profile curvature (rad m−1) as a measure of flow acceleration, also know as downslope chane in
slope angle.  
* elev: elevation (m above sea level) as the representation of different altitudinal zones of vegetation and
precipitation in the study area.  
* log10_carea: the decadic logarithm of the catchment area (log10 m2) representing the amount of
water flowing towards a location.
